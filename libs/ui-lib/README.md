# This is the Component Library that is use in the Dashboard project

This library was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev). This lib is created to be reusable and easy to share between other projects, also to have a own space to generate all the components and isolate the test, in this case I use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) in order to not use a css tool but would be a good practice to use [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) or [mui](https://mui.com/) or a token base design system to have more control between the components.

The Icons components are in one single file and could be autogenerated from SVGs in this case I use [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/) playground so I can generate icons directly from the svg using [Phospor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) as the source.

To use any component you can use the nx component gerator as `nx g @nrwl/react:component <name-component> --project=ui-lib` and you easily replace the name of the component that you would like to generate.

## Running the storybook

To test the components and also see the list of components available you should run `yarn storybook` or `npm storybook` in the root.
